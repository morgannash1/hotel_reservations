    "Maintaining occupancy is a huge challenge for the modern hotel industry. Intense competition, outdated technology systems, as well as the ease of online booking (and cancelling), are just a few of the issues that hotels are required to battle. It goes without saying that every cancelled booking means revenue is lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Aggressive pricing from competitors, along with the rise of short-term rental platforms like AirBnb, make guest retention increasingly difficult.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* On top of that, many of the hotel reservation systems are outdated and lack the capabilities that are needed to predict customer behavior, which forces hotels to rely on static historical averages rather than real-time risk assessment.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Another reason for occupancy struggles is the ease of online booking and common \"free cancellation\" policies. This allows for customers to make multiple reservations simultaneously, which greatly increases the chance of last-minute cancellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this, it's not shocking that your hotel is having issues with cancelled reservations, and we understand the immediate need for a predictive intervention system. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are hoping to help with that by creating a classification model that predicts when a reservation is \"high risk\" so your team can intervene and reach out with incentives to secure the booking."

    "\n",
    "**Limited Geographic Scope and Timeline:** The data is restricted to a 1 hotel only and is slightly outdated with the latest record from 2018 (before the Covid-19 Pandemic). The hotel location is also undisclosed. The dataset creator, [Ahsan Raza](https://www.kaggle.com/ahsan81/datasets), commented in the Discussion section: \"This example data has been captured from single location/country which, due to discretionary reasons, cannot be disclosed.\" This adds a limit to the model's ability to generalize well to other locations after 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Missing External and Factors:** The dataset lacks external and economic influences. Information about competitor pricing, weather forecasts, or large events taking place nearby are just to name a few outside factors that frequently drive cancellation decisions, but they are invisible to the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of Detailed Guest and Pricing Data:** Certain customer demographic details (like age and income), as well as records of the actual price paid by the customers (only the average is included) are absent. This limits the model's ability to truly understand a customer's price sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Ambiguity:** Interpretation is hampered by the ciphered room type values, which cannot be leveraged fully without the encoding key, which is not included. This prevents us from deriving insights about specific room types."
